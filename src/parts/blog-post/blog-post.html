            The global economy faces a critical juncture with a number of parallel and related crises. 2023 promises to be a tougher ride for most businesses, investors and consumers globally, but there is always opportunity in volatility. We analyze the top 10 trends we expect as policymakers do their best to navigate this economic, geopolitical and regulatory polycrisis. Rarely has the world faced this many interconnected crises but we expect that the outlook in 2024 will be less volatile.          </div>

            The West, and in particular the United States, has a very complicated economic and national security relationship with China after years of trade tensions, and now the war in Ukraine. Back in 2015, Premier Li Keqiang outlined China’s plan to dominate in high tech sectors–such as artificial intelligence and machine learning–in the “Made in China 2025” strategy. President Xi has continued to pursue a policy of forced technology transfers and government subsidies for strategically important sectors. In response, the Biden Administration has become increasingly aggressive in its efforts to contain China and stall its technological and military progress with the CHIPS Act and export controls on technology.

              Most immediately, this will raise tensions between China and Taiwan–a key strategic ally of the U.S.–and, perhaps more than any other part of the world, a country upon which the West and China are entirely dependent for next generation sophisticated semiconductors. U.S. efforts to wean itself from dependency on Taiwan will likely take several years to work, and in the meanwhile, a Chinese takeover would be very nearly crippling. Right now, there is a cold war over future technologies, with very real economic casualties on both sides. In China, the technology and military complexes have been impaired by new U.S. export restrictions.            </div>

              As governments and businesses around the world strive to return to life as it was before the COVID-19 pandemic, they need to be prepared in 2023 for a new “age of pandemics.” Multiple forces are conspiring together to increase the frequency with which new diseases emerge and then spread around the world: deforestation, intensive animal agriculture, urbanization, migration and travel. Climate change is amplifying all of those forces and adding in a new threat—warmer temperatures—making “tropical” diseases now routine in non-tropical countries. 
              For example, the Dengue virus used to be something people only worried about if they lived or traveled near the equator—now you can be infected by it living in France and Arizona.          </div>

Anti-vaccine groups are using the same information tactics as political movements, which may be leading to the return of previously eliminated diseases like polio to the U.S. and the UK. War and civil disruption further complicate access to sanitation, medications and health care, leading to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable and gastrointestinal diseases.</div>
